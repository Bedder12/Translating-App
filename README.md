# Translating-App
This Android application represents a translation app that implements ML Kit for text translation using Firebase. The app allows smooth and efficient text translation and integrates Firebase to enhance language translation. Additionally, it includes built-in speech recognition for voice input, converting speech to text before translating it into a chosen target language. Developed in Kotlin, the app uses Google Play services and Material Design components to offer a seamless and visually appealing user experience. It is designed with clear separation between the user interface and logic, following Android naming conventions and ensuring compatibility with Android versions 9 and above. The project also focuses on a clean, object-oriented code structure, documented for easy maintenance and scalability.
